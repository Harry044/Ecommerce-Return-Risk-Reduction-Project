📦 E-Commerce Return Risk Analysis
🧭 Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts product return risks in e-commerce using Python (data analysis & modeling) and Power BI (visualization).
It helps businesses understand which products and regions have higher return rates and take data-driven actions to minimize them.

The final Power BI dashboard provides a visual summary of:

Total sales & transaction overview

Average return risk percentage

Top high-risk products

Return risk distribution by country

Relationship between product price and return probability

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Tool / Library	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)	Data cleaning, feature engineering, logistic regression
Power BI	Dashboard creation & visualization
Excel / CSV	Initial data inspection
ChatGPT (OpenAI)	Help in planning, code guidance, and report preparation
⚙️ Steps Involved

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicates, nulls, and invalid values

Created features: IsReturn, ReturnProbability, TotalSales

Model Development (Python)

Trained Logistic Regression model to predict return probability

Exported predictions to High_Risk_Products.csv

Dashboard Design (Power BI)

KPIs: Total Sales, Average Return Risk %, Total Transactions

Visuals:

Bar chart – Return probability by product

Map – Return risk by country

Scatter plot – Unit price vs return probability

Table – Product details with filters

📊 Key Insights

Low-cost, high-quantity items showed higher return probability.

Certain countries like Australia and UK had moderate to high return risk.

Products with complex descriptions or fragile materials tend to return more often.

Predictive insights can help improve product quality, descriptions, and policies.
